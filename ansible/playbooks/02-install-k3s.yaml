# Installs k3s on all nodes in the correct order:
#   1. Control plane first (k3s-server role)
#   2. Workers second (k3s-agent role, which delegates token retrieval to the CP)
#
# The join token is never stored anywhere — it is read live from the control plane
# using ansible.builtin.slurp and exists only in memory for the duration of the play.
