# ClusterIssuers — Let's Encrypt ACME via Cloudflare DNS-01
#
# Two issuers are defined:
#   letsencrypt-staging   — use first to validate DNS-01 works (no rate limits)
#   letsencrypt-production — switch to this once staging issues a valid cert
#
# ${ACME_EMAIL} and ${DOMAIN} are substituted at reconcile time by Flux
# post-build variable substitution from the cluster-vars ConfigMap.
# See: task configure-cluster-vars
#
# The cloudflare-api-token Secret is created by cloudflare-token-external-secret.yaml.
